🧠 Goal

Create a simulated $1,000,000 portfolio where you:

Pull real market data

Test strategies

Track performance

Learn Linux + Python + Finance together

🪜 Phase 1 — Build Your Environment (Week 1)

You already have the right stack.

1) Linux / WSL foundation

Focus on:

File navigation

Installing Python packages

Running scripts

Git workflow

Learn:

cd, ls, mkdir, rm

pip install

virtual environments

Why this matters:
Real quant/dev work happens in Linux environments.

2) Core Python tools to install

Inside WSL:

pandas → data analysis

matplotlib → charts

jupyter → research notebooks

yfinance / Alpha Vantage → data

backtrader → strategy testing

Your machine becomes a research lab.

📊 Phase 2 — Define the Portfolio Rules (Week 1–2)

Before touching code, decide the simulation rules.

Portfolio structure example

Start simple:

$1,000,000 total capital

Max 10–15 stocks

No leverage

Rebalance monthly

Decide:

Tech heavy?

ETF focused?

Dividend?

Growth?

Quant strategy?

This is your “fund mandate”.

📈 Phase 3 — Data Pipeline (Week 2)

Use:

Yahoo Finance API

Alpha Vantage

Quandl

Goal:
Automatically pull:

Price history

Volume

Indicators

Start with:

S&P 500 stocks

Top tech companies

ETFs

🧪 Phase 4 — Strategy Building (Week 3–6)

This is where the real learning happens.

Start with SIMPLE strategies:

Beginner strategies

Moving average crossover

Buy when price dips 5%

Momentum strategy

Equal-weight portfolio

Then evolve into:

Volatility-based allocation

Sector rotation

Mean reversion

Use:

Pandas for calculations

Matplotlib for visualization

🔬 Phase 5 — Backtesting (Week 5–8)

Use Backtrader to simulate:

“What if I ran this strategy since 2015?”

You learn:

Risk

Drawdowns

Sharpe ratio

Win/loss rate

This is what quants actually do.

💼 Phase 6 — Portfolio Tracker (Week 6–10)

Build a system that tracks:

Current value

Gains/losses

Allocation %

Best/worst performers

Options:

Jupyter dashboard

CSV log system

Python script that runs daily

📓 Phase 7 — Research Journal (ONGOING)

This is what separates amateurs from serious investors.

Track:

Why you bought

Why you sold

What worked

What failed

Use:

Jupyter notebooks

GitHub repo

🧱 Phase 8 — GitHub Project Structure

Organize like a real dev:

quant-portfolio/
│
├── data/
├── strategies/
├── backtests/
├── notebooks/
├── portfolio_tracker/
└── README.md


This becomes your:

Resume project

Quant portfolio

Internship proof

🧠 Phase 9 — Learn Finance Alongside Coding

Use Investopedia to understand:

PE ratio

Market cap

Risk metrics

Portfolio theory

Blend:

Finance knowledge

Python automation

That’s FinTech.
